# Employee Attrition

## Project Description
Human resource management plays a crucial role in an organization's success. Consequently, comprehending the factors that contribute to employee attrition is imperative for effective talent management. This approach enables an organization to save costs on recruitment and training in the short run, while also identifying potential internal problems such as management structure and corporate culture that may need to be addressed in the long term. According to Chakraverty (2006), the costs of employee attrition, including the direct costs of recruitment, training, and lost productivity, as well as the indirect costs of decreased morale, reduced team cohesion, and knowledge loss. In light of these costs, organizations must take a strategic approach to address employee attrition and retain top talent. Therefore, proactive measures are necessary for organizations to maintain a competitive edge and ensure long-term success. 

## Project Objective
This project aims to identify the primary factors that drive employee attrition, which will enable us to predict whether a future employee is at risk of leaving the organization.

## Results and Interpretations
Key findings reveal that working overtime is the strongest predictor of higher attrition rates, while working experience and the time spent in current roles and with managers could play significant roles in lower attrition rates. 
The larger implications of our analysis emphasize the importance of organizations fostering a supportive and engaging work environment to ensure employee retention. Addressing work-life balance concerns, offering growth opportunities, and nurturing strong manager-employee relationships are essential in reducing attrition rates and contributing to the organization's long-term success.
